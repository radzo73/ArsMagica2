compendium.absorption.page1=As a faint light shimmered across his skin, the mage felt his resilience grow for a short while.
compendium.accelerate.page1=This spell causes targeted blocks to tick faster. Note that it does not make tile entities any quicker. This spell is best used in a shape like beam, wall, or zone, due to its need to be cast multiple times to have any real effect.
compendium.appropriation.page1=You can appropriate one block or entity into your spell. Casting the spell again will place a picked up entity or block at the targeted location.
compendium.astral_distortion.page1=As I tried to step into the void, the warp shimmered and seemed to solidify. I walked face first into it, much to the amusement of my students. This effect seemed to prevent my teleportation abilities entirely. I had to turn this against Endermen as well.
compendium.attract.page1=You create an area of negative pressure around you, pulling everything living in towards you.
compendium.banish_rain.page1=Rain rain, go away. Come again another day! Who would have thought that those were the words to the spell? If used in the corresponding ritual, this spell can also call rain too. See the #5Rituals#0 page for details.
compendium.blind.page1=Having a fireball to throw at dark mages is great. Making it so they also can't see to retaliate is better.
compendium.blink.page1=You can teleport a short distance directly forward the way you are facing. Blink can take you through solid walls, but will make every effort to ensure you don't get stuck in one.
compendium.blizzard.page1=You have learned to summon a fearsome blizzard, which will slow and damage any entities in its radius. Blizzard has a built-in AoE to it. A blizzard cannot be summoned within 5 blocks of another existing blizzard. It initially does less damage than other attacks, but scales more quickly with modifiers. It also has the unique capability to deal damage more often than regular attacks. Though blizzard will harm all entities in its radius, it will never harm its caster.
compendium.charm.page1=You can charm creatures into fighting for you, and certain creatures will do special things when charmed. Charming also causes creatures to breed (if they are capable of doing so by other means).
compendium.chrono_anchor.page1=You can anchor yourself in time. When the timer runs out, you are transported back to the place you cast this spell, with your health, mana, burnout, and hunger returning to what they were when the spell was first cast.
compendium.create_water.page1=You can coalesce moisture from the air around into one location, creating water where there was none. This will not work in the nether. It can also be used to fill a cauldron.</
compendium.daylight.page1=You have gained the ability to control time. This spell will cause the time to move to Dawn.
compendium.dig.page1=The ground shatters with a snap of your fingers. Harder blocks take more mana to break. Dig starts out equivalent to an Iron pickaxe, but can be upgraded with the use of the #5Mining Power#0 modifier.
compendium.disarm.page1=Now that you have learned to summon tools to your hand, it was a small step to be able to make others drop what they are holding.
compendium.dispel.page1=Creating a localized field of deficit, you can remove a number of effects on your target. Dispel also wreaks havoc on summoned creatures, banishing them back into the ether.
compendium.divine_intervention.page1=You have mastered teleportation magic, to the level at which you can transcend interdimensional barriers, and can enter the overworld from almost anywhere. If cast when you are already in the overworld, you will be returned to your bed, or to spawn if no bed exists.
compendium.drought.page1=You have taken your knowledge of creating water and have reversed the process. This spell will draw water out of whatever it hits, removing water blocks and turning dirt, grass, sandstone and mycelium to sand, withering plants it hits, and stone to cobblestone.
compendium.drown.page1=You can create water directly inside the target's lungs, causing them to take drowning damage.
compendium.ender_intervention.page1=You have mastered teleportation magic, to the level at which you can transcend interdimensional barriers, and can enter the nether from almost anywhere.
compendium.entangle.page1=At your command, vines can burst from the ground and ensnare your target, holding them completely immobile.
compendium.falling_star.page1=You can call down a star from the skies and cause it to strike all entities within the blast radius. It will harm friendly targets but not the caster. There is a short delay between casting the spell and the impact. This spell will not work underground (the star will fall onto the surface).
compendium.fire_damage.page1=With a word, I released my will and fire erupted from out in front of me, searing everything in its path. Fire damage is hard hitting, but many nether mobs are immune to its effects.
compendium.fire_rain.page1=You have learned to summon a terrible firestorm, which will do large amounts of damage any entities in its radius. Firestorm has a built-in AoE to it. A firestorm cannot be summoned within 5 blocks of another existing firestorm. It initially does less damage than other attacks, but scales more quickly with modifiers. It also has the unique capability to deal damage more often than regular attacks. Firestorm does not ignite the ground. Though firestorm will harm all entities in its radius, it will never harm its caster.
compendium.flight.page1=With a word, I rose into the air and mingled with the clouds and sky. I flew effortlessly, quick and agile. The skies were mine alone.
compendium.fling.page1=Wind whirled around under the creeper and suddenly all at once blew straight up, sending it skyward.
compendium.forge.page1=You have gained fine control over fire and can use it to magically smelt blocks where they stand, without charring them to ash.
compendium.freeze.page1=Eira breathed deeply and opened her eyes. The caps of the mountains now glistened white with snow and a sublime frost covered everything. Water had become ice. Enemies moved at a crawl. Perfect.
compendium.frost_damage.page1=Many underestimate the power that frost can wield. The creeping chill can bypass many armors, and frost is devstating against the denizens of the nether. Frost damage also applies a brief slowing effect when it hits.
compendium.fury.page1=You can send yourself into an absolute rage, dealing increased damage, moving extremely fast, passively regenerating, and mining at inhuman speeds. When the effect ends, you are left exhausted for a few moments and must recover.
compendium.gravity_well.page1=You have learned to create a localized gravity well under your target, greatly increasing the speed at which they fall.
compendium.grow.page1=Pouring energy into plants, equal to months of talking to them, will cause them to grow more rapidly.
compendium.harvest_plants.page1=You can cause all plants, leaves, and flowers to be harvested.
compendium.haste.page1=Wrapping the target's legs in arcane energy, a mage can greatly increase movement speed.
compendium.heal.page1=By greatly increasing the amount of power put into regenerative effects, a mage can knit almost any injury back together. The effect is taxing, however.
compendium.ignition.page1=Many magi see fire as a damaging, destructive force, and that can be true. But how many hear fire and imagine lighting a stove, campfire or candle?
compendium.invisibility.page1=You can bend light around yourself to become effectively invisible.
compendium.knockback.page1=Not many mages want to be in melee range. This allows that situation to be corrected.
compendium.leap.page1=Gathering wind around me, I propelled myself into the air. I held the wind close through the jump, releasing it in an upward burst just as I landed, protecting me from the fall.
compendium.levitate.page1=Through practicing air magic, you can now hold yourself suspended in midair. With small wind currents, you can move slowly about while floating.
compendium.life_drain.page1=By creating a sinister link with the target's life force, you can siphon it off into your own, bolstering your own health.
compendium.life_tap.page1=If a mage is desparate and mana is scarce, he can fuel his spells using his own life force.
compendium.light.page1=You can light up an area with magic. Lights can be recolored after the fact by right clicking them with a dye. Forge Ore Dictionary is supported for valid Dyes.
compendium.lightning_damage.page1=I held my hands in front of me, and with a sharp crack a bolt of brilliant white lightning forked across the sky. His metal armor acted as a lightning rod, drawing each bolt down into him. Lightning does an exceptional amount of damage, but carries a hefty mana cost.
compendium.magic_damage.page1=Magical damage differs from physical damage in that it bypasses many kinds of armors and attacks the target's aura directly - which can be just as devastating, if not more. This makes summoned and charmed creatures especially vulnerable, making them take triple damage.
compendium.mana_drain.page1=You can create a parasitic bond with the target's aura, draining their mana and boosting your own.
compendium.mana_link.page1=You have discovered the secret to linking your mana together with another entity. When you cast this spell, your target will be able to draw upon your mana pool as if it were their own. !d The target will use their own mana first, then will begin to draw upon yours.
compendium.mana_link.page2=It has a limited radius, but can have radius modifiers if you so desire. If the target leaves the radius, the link is not broken, but is rather temporarily disabled. When they again return into the radius, the link will reactivate and will function again. To end the link, simply cast the spell on the target again. !d You can link your own mana to multiple entities, and on the other side, you can have multiple links coming in from other sources.
compendium.mana_shield.page1=You can drain your entire mana pool to create a shield on your target.
compendium.mana_blast.page1=You found a way to cause your entire mana pool to empty on a target in an offensive manner.
compendium.mark.page1=You can magically mark a location, which you can recall to from almost anywhere.
compendium.moonrise.page1=You have gained the ability to control time. This spell will cause the time to move to Dusk.
compendium.night_vision.page1=Your knowledge of light has allowed you to devise a spell that will let you amplify light levels, effectively letting you see in the dark.
compendium.physical_damage.page1=Often a young mage will begin his training with simple physical force. More often he will continue that training by smacking his colleagues in the back of the head with more physical force. Force is a physical damage type, and does not pierce armor.
compendium.place_block.page1=You can use this spell part to place blocks! Can be extremely powerful when combined with different shape combinations. In order to place a block, you need to set the spell to place it, and you need to have at least one of said block in your inventory. No creating them out of thin air, sorry!
compendium.place_block.page2=To set the block to be placed, cast the spell on a block while sneaking. You need to be sneaking when the spell actually applies, so keep that in mind when using something like Projectile. It's recommended to not use AoE to set the block, as it can sometimes set it to something you don't expect (as it will apply to everything in a radius, setting the block over and over). To see what block the spell will place, hover your mouse over it in your inventory and press SHIFT.
compendium.plant.page1=You can cause seeds from your inventory to be planted in the ground, if conditions are right for it to grow. Best coupled with AoE or some other such shape for rapid planting.
compendium.plow.page1=You can cause the earth to churn at your command, creating deep furrows ideal for planting.
compendium.random_teleport.page1=You can randomly teleport your target a short distance away.
compendium.recall.page1=You can tune your teleportation magic to home in on a mark you have left, transporting you or your target back to its location. !d The ritual allows you to teleport you to a gateway or a player to you. !l -To teleport to a gateway, just throw the 3 colors of the target gateway on the ground (in order) and cast the spell. !l -To teleport a player to you, you'll need to know his Runes. Then you just need to throw them in order and add vinteum dust.
compendium.reflect.page1=You can change the makeup of your shield so that spells will bounce off instead of reducing physical damage. This cannot be active at the same time as shield.
compendium.regeneration.page1=I wrapped my arm in a healing light, and watched as every injury, down to the last bruise, slowly vanished before my eyes.
compendium.repel.page1=You can create a singularity in space, which, as long as you maintain it, will radiate waves of force, pushing enemies and deflecting arrows away from you.
compendium.rift.page1=You can tear open a rift in space, granting access to a small dimension to store items in. The rift lasts for 60 seconds before closing automatically. More Buff Power modifiers give greater storage access. Sneak+Right click to close the rift once it is opened.
compendium.shield.page1=You can summon arcane energy to shield yourself. This shield will reduce all damage taken. This cannot be active at the same time as reflect.
compendium.shrink.page1=You can make yourself tiny! When this effect is active, you are physically smaller, so you can fit through 1x1 gaps. Due to your light weight, you fall slowly enough that landing doesn't hurt either. However, all damage you do is halved.
compendium.silence.page1=You can silence another entity, preventing all spell casting for a short duration. THe duration cannot be extended.
compendium.slow.page1=By applying the equivalent of a magical ball and chain, a mage can greatly slow the movements of his target.
compendium.slowfall.page1=Become light as a feather, and fall without fear.
compendium.storm.page1=The clouds darkened, and rain began to fall. The wind howled, and a flash of lightning streaked across the sky, leaving bright flashes in my vision. The thunder was deafening. Lightning struck all around me at each enemy. The strain of maintaining the storm was immense.
compendium.summon.page1=You have learned to harvest the souls of creatures you defeat in combat. These souls can be used in creating a spell to summon that creature to protect you. !d To summon a creature, first craft a #5Crystal Phylactery#0. Once you kill something while holding an empty phylactery, that phylactery will become #9attuned#0 to that specific mob. Kill enough of the same mob and you will fill the phylactery. !d During spell creation, you can throw in any filled phylactery when prompted by the lectern. This step is what determines what your spell will summon.
compendium.summon.page2=Summoned creatures drop no loot, and no xp, but can be interacted with normally, such as breeding, milking cows, or riding horses. Horses are the exception to the item drop rule and will drop saddles and armor given to them. !l Tameable creatures such as wolves and cats are automatically tamed to their owner upon summoning. !d Bosses cannot be trapped in phylacteries in survival/adventure mode.
compendium.swift_swim.page1=By manipulating water currents, you can propel yourself along much more quickly underwater.
compendium.telekinesis.page1=You can use your magic to amplify your brainwaves, giving them physical form. These waves can be used to pull items and XP towards a point in front of you. Rolling the mouse wheel while using the spell can change the distance of the point closer or farther away from you.
compendium.transplace.page1=Your knowledge of teleportation magic has grown. You can now switch places with your target.
compendium.true_sight.page1=Your magical sight allows you to see things as they really are. Who knows what beauties...and horrors you will discover.
compendium.water_breathing.page1=You can use your magic to pull oxygen from the water, allowing you to get enough to not drown.
compendium.watery_grave.page1=The water seemed to come alive, wrapping tendrils around the light mage and dragging him down into the black, crushing depths. His friend on the shore could only watch helplessly, for to jump into the water would mean the same fate for him.
compendium.wizards_autumn.page1=You have learned to focus your digging magic into a small radius that directly affects leaves. This component has a built in AoE that can be modified with Radius modifiers. You can use it to clear those pesky hard to reach leaves.

compendium.projectile.page1=You are able to focus your will into a concentrated ball, which you can propel forwards away from you. The projectile will last for 5 seconds of flight, or until it strikes something. It will by default pass through water and non-collidable blocks unless you modify it with target non-solid blocks.
compendium.channel.page1=Through intense concentration, a mage can maintain a flow of magic on themselves. This is useful for things like Telekinesis, Healing, Attract, and Storm.
compendium.beam.page1=It isn't much of a mental shift to switch from a channeled spell to a beam. The amount of strain, however, is another story. A beam is a much more controlled version of a channeled spell.
compendium.self.page1=One of the simplest forms of magic application is applying the magic to yourself. The distance is low, and the target is willing. You only hope you don't accidentally light yourself on fire.
compendium.touch.page1=Simply wrap your hand in magic, and reach out. Touch is a very short range shape; it does not follow the block highlighting. You need to be almost bumping into a block for touch to apply its effect.
compendium.zone.page1=You have learned to focus your will into an area effect that will persist for a time.
compendium.aoe.page1=After charging your spell, you can shape it into a blast that radiates outwards from the spell's origin. If gravity is applied, AoE will search downwards for blocks to apply to. This is useful for lowering a hill without changing its natural shape, and many other things. An AoE spell will not affect the caster.
compendium.chain.page1=You can shape your magic into a blast that jumps from one target to the next. Chain by default contains an 8-block built in touch-like component (with an extended range - 8 blocks or so), so there is no need to add additional stages; though you can if you like, projectile for example to start the chain somewhere else. A chain spell cannot affect the caster. Chain jump range can be extended by using the #5Range#0 modifier, and the number of jumps can be increased by using #5Procs#0.
compendium.rune.page1=You can create a magically-infused rune on the ground that when triggered can apply powerful buffs...or deadly traps.
compendium.contingency_fall.page1=You have figured out a spell shape that triggers when falling the instant before you hit the ground. !d Oh gravity, thou art a heartless... !d You can only have one contingency active at a time.
compendium.contingency_damage.page1=You have managed to create a spell that triggers only when you get hurt. !d Let's play shot for shot. !d You can only have one contingency active at a time.
compendium.contingency_fire.page1=You've decided you really don't like being on fire anymore. To that end, you made a spell that will light up when the flames do. !d You can only have one contingency active at a time.
compendium.contingency_health.page1=No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife between the shoulder blades will seriously cramp his style. You think you have found a way to make them regret trying that. Or need two knives. !d This contingency procs when your health is less than or equal to 25% of maximum. !d You can only have one contingency active at a time.
compendium.contingency_death.page1=You may get me, but in those few seconds it takes you, I will have all the time I need to ensure you come along for the ride. !d You can only have one contingency active at a time.
compendium.binding.page1=You can create solid objects out of nothing! The binding shape allows you to bind tools to yourself, which drain constant mana while bound, and burst mana when used instead of durability. Dropping the item with the drop hotkey (default 'q') will instead unbind it.
compendium.wall.page1=You can manifest a wall in front of you. The wall will run perpendicular to your current direction. Walls function similarly to zones, but with a different form factor. Walls also apply their effects more rapidly.
compendium.wave.page1=Project a wave of magic in front of you that rolls forward, applying its effect to everything in its path.
compendium.toggle.page1=Modify your spell to be a continuous cast! While you may not be able to have multiple spells with this shape cast at once, sure there's some use for it...

compendium.gravity.page1=Amplifies the gravity of certain spell shapes. Zones and projectiles will be affected by gravity. AoE spells will search farther down when applying to terrain for a valid spot to apply (this is useful as it causes it to hug the terrain).
compendium.bounce.page1=Causes the projectile spell shape to bounce off surfaces.
compendium.damage.page1=Amplifies the damage dealt by spells.
compendium.healing.page1=Amplifies the healing done by spells, or the damage dealt by healing spells to the undead.
compendium.speed.page1=Enhances the speed altering effects of spells, and the speed of projectiles.

compendium.range.page1=Increases the range of projectile and beam spells.
compendium.radius.page1=Increases the radius of zone and AoE spell shapes.
compendium.rune_procs.page1=Increases the number of times a rune can apply it's effect before being destroyed.
compendium.velocity_added.page1=Increases the amount of velocity added by spell parts such as #5Fling#0.
compendium.target_non_solid.page1=Allows the spell to target non-solid blocks (grass, water, lava) rather than passing through it.
compendium.lunar.page1=Powers up your spell at night. The closer to midnight time is (Starting at Dusk), the more damage and healing the spell does. After midnight, as dawn approaches, the spell will become weaker. Range, Duration, and Radius are all increased where applicable based on the phase of the moon (more power approaching full moon). More powerful than Solar due to nights not lasting as long as day.
compendium.solar.page1=Powers up your spell during the day. The closer to noon time is (Starting at Dawn), the more damage and healing the spell does. After noon, as dusk approaches, the spell will become weaker. Range, Duration, and Radius are all increased where applicable based on the phase of the moon (more power approaching new moon).
compendium.piercing.page1=Allows the spell to pierce through entities and blocks. 2 pierces are added per modifier, with a maximum of 6.
compendium.mining_power.page1=You have learned to put more power into your digging spells. This causes them to be able to dig more dense blocks that would require a better pickaxe. Each modifier bumps the spell up by one tool level. The base Dig spell operates at Stone pickaxe mining level.
compendium.prosperity.page1=Fortune strikes! You can make your digging spells more likely to drop additional ores, and your damaging spells more likely to cause enemies to drop better loot. Each modifier added is equivalent to one level of fortune/looting on the spell.
compendium.buff_power.page1=You can put more power into your buffs. Each modifier added increases the level of the buff applied. This will not affect duration.
compendium.dismembering.page1=You've decided that you like souvenirs. So much so, that you have discovered how to make your damaging spells leave some pieces intact. Each modifier adds 5% chance to drop a head when defeating an enemy.
compendium.feather_touch.page1=With great power comes broken valuables. You've learned to be more careful when casting your digging spells and break things less often. Each modifier is equivalent to one level of Silk Touch on the spell.
compendium.colour.page1=This modifier allows you to change the color of the particles on your spell. Want green fireballs? Have at it! Color is determined by the color dye that you throw in during the crafting process. Any one will be accepted, regardless of what the lectern prompts for.

compendium.affinity_gains.page1=You have decided that elemental attunement is more important than arcane knowledge. You can receive a boost to affinity gains in exchange for slower magic XP gain. This is a permanent effect.
compendium.augmented_casting.page1=You have figured out how to put everything you have into a spell cast. All of your spells are more powerful. Durations are longer, radii are bigger, and damage is increased.
compendium.extra_summon.page1=Why do things yourself when you can have others do them for you? You can now have one additional summoned/charmed creature or recruited mage (if you have the #5Mage Posse#0 talent)
compendium.mage_posse_i.page1=Your talents as a mage have impressed others, and your reputation precedes you. You can request that a light mage follow and guard you. This counts against your summon cap.
compendium.mage_posse_ii.page1=You have gained the trust of other mages to the point that they feel safe linking their magic to yours. Whenever you befriend a light mage, they will mana link to you.
compendium.mana_regen_i.page1=You are more attuned with the energy flowing through you. Your magic regenerates slightly faster than normal.

#Guides

compendium.category.guide.name=Guides

compendium.guide.your_first_spell.name=Your First Spell
compendium.your_first_spell.page1=Your First Spell !d To make a spell, you will first need to create an #5Occulus#0 and unlock at least one spell shape and one component. You start with three blue skill points to make this possible. Then, craft a writable book and head over to your #5Inscription Table#0. Place the book in the inscription table.
compendium.your_first_spell.page2=There are three sections of the Inscription Table UI that are of note. The source region is the large grey square at the top, and will contain all of your known shapes, components, and modifiers. The Shape Group section is identified by brown squares. There are multiple brown squares as multiple shape groups can be created. Finally there is the Spell Grammar section, which is the gray rectangle at the bottom.
compendium.your_first_spell.page3=Create #5Shape Groups#0 by dragging shapes and/or modifiers from the source region to any of the shape groups in the UI. You can create multiple shape groups in the same spell, three by default. Each shape group can have up to four shapes/modifiers. Shape groups cannot contain components. A good way to think about it is that shape groups are different means of targeting things with the spell, then the spell grammar is what the spell actually does.
compendium.your_first_spell.page4=Once your shape groups are created, drag the spell parts you want, in order, from the source region to the spell grammar section. The spell grammar section can contain spell shapes, components, and modifiers in addition to the shape groups. Once your combination is completed, go to your #5Crafting Altar#0 and place your book containing the spell recipe on the lectern.
compendium.your_first_spell.page5=Throw a #5blank rune#0 into the middle of the crafting altar to begin the process, then follow the book's prompts. The book itself is worth reading as well, as it contains a recap of what the spell recipe is for, the materials list for the spell and an affinity breakdown of the spell. Note that certain crafting altars can only craft spells that are so powerful. Too much power and bad things can happen. See the entry on the #5Crafting Altar#0 for more information.

compendium.affinities.page1=#5Affinity#0 represents a bond to certain areas of magic. You start with no affinity. Your affinity is represented as a small chart on the HUD, and can be viewed in more detail at an Occulus (craftable Block). 
compendium.affinities.page2=Your affinity will shift based on what spells you cast, meaning as you cast certain types of spells more often, you will get better at them. Casting spells of a differing affinity will shift you towards that affinity. Once you reach 100% in an affinity, you become locked to that affinity, and will need to read an opposing affinity tome to unlock your affinity, at which point normal progression will resume.
compendium.affinities.page3=Unlocking a full affinity will drop you down to 80% depth. Each spell component has an affinity. Components of the same affinity as you will cost less mana, and depending on your affinity depth (how far into the affinity you are), may not even cost reagents.
compendium.affinities.page4=Components of the opposing affinity, however, will cost more mana and again, depending on your affinity depth, may cost additional reagents. Affinities offer specific bonuses and disadvantages, described on the affinity-specific pages.

compendium.earth_affinity.page1=Earth affinity grants a minor defense bonus, due to your hardened skin. At max, you will have 10% overall damage reduction, applied before armor. This amount depends on your affinity depth into earth, and begins at 25% depth. !d With earth affinity, you are heavier, and as such you will sink more quickly in water (though never enough that you cannot surface), and you cannot fall as far without taking fall damage.
compendium.water_affinity.page1=Water affinity grants a bonus to swim speed as well as slower breath loss underwater. You are also not pushed by flowing water. Endermen that attack a full water-affinity mage will take damage as if they had touched water. !d Water affinity mages take damage periodically if exposed to fire, making the nether particularly dangerous. This damage will not take you below 75% health, and will not occur at all if you are lower.
compendium.air_affinity.page1=Air affinity grants a bonus to jump height and lets you fall farther before taking damage. These bonuses are dependent on your affinity depth: you can jump one block higher and fall one block farther at 50% depth. This bonus increases to 2 at 75%, and 3 at full depth. !d Air affinity mages are hindered by rain and storms; the wind blows you around and you must move slower. #5Sneaking#0 or casting a spell of #5Gravity Well#0 can negate the effect and allow you to move in the storm, albeit slowly.
compendium.fire_affinity.page1=Fire affinity grants damage reduction in fire and lava, though never complete immunity. The protection is directly related to your affinity depth, and reaches 60% reduction at full depth. Punching enemies at full affinity will light them on fire. !d Once your fire affinity reaches 50%, you will start to take damage periodically when touching water sources. This damage will not take you down below 75% health and will not occur if lower.
compendium.nature_affinity.page1=Nature affinity gives you additional seeds and saplings when harvesting plants from around the world. At 50% depth, you will gain the Thorns effect, causing melee attackers to take damage (similar to the armor enchant). This damage increases at 75% affinity and at full affinity. At full nature affinity you also slowly regenerate hunger in direct sunlight. At full nature affinity, you can extend roots into the ground, allowing you to climb certain surfaces like a spider does.
compendium.nature_affinity.page2=Nature affinity causes you to move slightly slower due to your roots. At full nature affinity depth, you lose hunger more quickly at night or in dark areas
compendium.nature_affinity.page3=At full nature affinity, you gain the aspect of a leaf on the wind, negating all fall damage and falling more slowly. You can sneak to fall at normal speed. This will still cause fall damage to be negated.
compendium.ice_affinity.page1=Ice affinity causes attackers to be slowed. At 50% depth, while sneaking you will freeze water to ice in front of you, allowing you to make bridges as you move. At 100% depth, you can freeze lava to obsidian. !d All ice mages move slightly slower due to being cold blooded, unless on ice or water.
compendium.lightning_affinity.page1=Lightning affinity causes you to run faster. The speed increase is directly related to your affinity depth, ranging from 1 to 30%. At 50% depth, you gain the ability to step up over one block high ledges. !d Unfortunately due to your affinity you are also sort of short out in water. You can also light nearby TNT and supercharge nearby creepers! Don't worry though, as you gain more control over your electric nature, you will be able to reduce the TNT and Creeper effects.
compendium.life_affinity.page1=Life affinity causes you to very slowly regenerate additional life. The regen speed is directly related to your depth. This regen happens regardless of your hunger level. !d Due to your close ties with life, any time you kill something it makes you sick and nauseated for a while.
compendium.arcane_affinity.page1=Arcane affinity causes all spells to cost 5% less mana, in addition to other mana reductions. At full depth, there is also a chance that upon casting a spell, you will gain the clarity effect, causing your next spell to cost 0 mana. !d As a disadvantage, all magical damage sources do more damage to you.
compendium.ender_affinity.page1=Ender affinity gives you poison resistance at 50% depth, and at 75% depth you gain night vision automatically in dark areas. At full ender affinity, Endermen will not attack you, unless you attack them first. !d Due to your dark nature, your maximum health is reduced in light, and at higher ender affinity, it is reduced in water as well. Masters of the ender are rumored to have evolved beyond this weakness.

compendium.spell_creation.page1=Creating spells is somewhat time consuming, but simple. First, learn some spell parts using an #5Occulus#0. Next, lay out the spell you want to create at an #5Inscription Table#0. Place the book from the inscription table on the lectern of your crafting altar structure, and throw in a #5Blank Rune#0.
compendium.spell_creation.page2=The book will guide you through the rest of the process, showing you what you need. When Etherium is required during the spell creation process, use a #5crystal wrench#0 to change the power type if necessary, then flip the switch on the multiblock. The structure will draw enough power, then turn the switch off automatically.
compendium.spell_creation.page3=Once your spell is created, equip it and right click to name it and set the icon. Once you have done this correctly, the spell will be castable! Otherwise it will show the customization UI again when you cast.
compendium.infusion.page1=#5Infusion#0 is a process in which AM armor will drain mana from your mana pool to repair itself. Due to this mechanic, all AM armor has low durability, and won't last in a prolonged fight. Taking the armor off will cause it to stop infusing - it must be equipped for the mechanic to function. If the armor is at full durability, there is no mana cost.
compendium.mana.page1=Mana is your magical energy level. You gain more mana by increasing your Magic Level. !d Mana regenerates over time, but you can gain boosts to regeneration by eating a #9Mana Cake#0 or standing near an Obelisk, Celestial Prism, or Black Aurem with more than 10% charge. #9Mana Potions#0 and #9Mana Potion Bundles#0 can be used to give an instant boost to mana. Mana is represented by a blue bar on your HUD. You can use "#2/amuicfg#0" to toggle an option to show the actual numeric values of your mana.
compendium.magic_level.page1=Magic Level represents your strength as a mage. As your Magic Level increases, so will your Mana and Burnout capacities. Magic level can be increased by casting valid spells. A valid spell cast is one that does what is intended, meaning casting fire bolt at a wall for an hour won't get you anywhere. Certain components that have valid targets more rarely award more magical XP towards the next level. Your Magic Level is represented by a blue number on your HUD. You can use "#2/amuicfg#0" to toggle an option to show the actual numeric values of your magic XP bar.
compendium.burnout.page1=Burnout is your level of strain when casting spells. The higher your Burnout, the more mana each spell will cost. Casting more powerful spells will cause more Burnout. It will decrease over time. Gaining Magic Levels will give you a higher Burnout cap, allowing you to cast more spells before becoming completely fatigued. Your Burnout level is displayed as a red bar on the HUD. You can use "#2/amuicfg#0" to toggle an option to show the actual numeric values of your burnout.
compendium.rituals.page1=Summoning Rituals are what are performed to call upon bosses in Ars Magica. See the #5bosses section#0 of this compendium for the rituals specific to each boss.
compendium.moonstone_meteor.page1=On occasion, during the night, small meteors may crash down into the overworld. This is the only way to obtain moonstone ore. A full moon increases the odds of one spawning. The meteor always falls within 32 blocks of a player, and they will only ever fall on a biome's cover block. Meaning unless you have a house made of grass, it won't even hit your home. If you do have a house made of grass, then what is wrong with you? Didn't you ever read the three little pigs?
compendium.magic_resistance.page1=As the name suggests, this enchant offers protection against magic damage. There are 4 ranks to the enchantment, and it goes on armor.
compendium.soulbound.page1=Ever get tired of losing your gear on death? You can fix that now. The soulbound enchant can be applied to just about any item that accepts enchantments, and will cause that item to remain in your inventory on death. You will respawn with the item in the same slot in your inventory it was when you died. Soulbound has a max enchantment level of 1.
compendium.armor_xp_infusion.page1=Whenever you gain XP, any equipped armor will gain some too. The amount gained is equal to the total amount of XP you just gained divided evenly among all equipped armor pieces. Any armor can gain XP. Stored armor XP can be used at an #9Armor Imbuement Table#0.
compendium.silver_skills.page1=Silver skills are skills inside the occulus that cannot be obtained in normal ways. To unlock a silver skill, the correct spell combination must be crafted, and then cast. There are a few rules to silver skill unlock combinations that will make them somewhat easier to decipher.
compendium.silver_skills.page2= 1.) All parts required to unlock a silver skill will be in the #9same tree as the silver skill itself#0. !d 2.) All silver skills require between #9 2 and 4 components and/or modifiers to unlock#0. !d 3.) Shapes do not matter in unlocking a silver skill. #9Any shape can be used#0. !d 4.) The combination #9does not have to be in any specific order#0. As long as the correct components are present, it will work.
compendium.silver_skills.page3= 5.) The components/modifiers #9all have to be in the same stage#0. !d 6.) The components and modifiers #9will logcally make sense with the silver skill#0. For example, Firestorm won't require drown. !d 7.) The spell to unlock a silver skill may not be the most practical for common use.

compendium.structure.gateway.name=Gateway

compendium.crafting_altar_structure.page1=Harnessing the forces of creation, the crafting altar allows mages to work miracles of magic. This is where you will create all of your spells in Ars Magica. The structure is upgradeable by 2 main groups, the caps and the main material. Both groups individually increase the available power of the altar and allow it to make more powerful spells. The main blocks and the caps (grand total of 5 in the structure).
compendium.crafting_altar_structure.page2=These stack cumulatively, so for example wood planks with glass caps would equal a maximum of 2 effects, whereas stone bricks with redstone caps would have a maximum of 4 effects in a spell.
compendium.gateway.page1=Gateways are quite efficient at short range, but longer distances require significantly more Etherium. The maximum range for a Gateway has been tested to be roughly 12km, though an extreme amount of Etherium is required to traverse such a span. A keystone can be inserted into the Keystone Receptacle in order to lock the gateway to the keystone's rune combination.
compendium.gateway.page2=Only then by activating another gateway with a matching keystone can one arrive at the keyed gateway. If the key does not match or no keystone is held at all when the gate is activated, it will be as if the keyed gateway doesn't even exist. This method can be used to control where you will wind up in the gateway network.

compendium.obelisk.page1=The Obelisk is a runed block that is used to generate #5Etherium#0 (the power system in Ars Magica 2). It acts as a magical furnace, and burns Vinteum Dust or Liquid Etherium to generate power. !d It can be altered using #9Rituals#0 to become a #4Black Aurem#0 or a #9Celestial Prism#0.
compendium.obelisk.page2=The Obelisk is somewhat of a magical furnace. It can generate Etherium by burning #5Vinteum Dust#0 or #5Liquid Etherium#0 out of a bucket. The Obelisk generates #5Neutral Etherium#0.
compendium.obelisk.page3=The structure depicted here does not have to be built all at once; it can be built in sections. The #9Wizard's Chalk Circle#0 is a standalone upgrade that when completed, will increase the output of the Obelisk's burn capabilities. The #9Pillars#0 are another upgrade, and will further increase the output of the Obelisk. !d If space is a concern however, these upgrades are not required for the Obelisk to function.
compendium.mana_drain_block.page1=The Draining Well is a way for mages to convert their mana into etherium, unfortunatly due to the nature of mana, only neutral etherium is produced. Using redstone it is possible to create mana out of etherium. !d The Draining Well requires a multiblock structure to function.
compendium.essence_refiner.page1=The essence refiner takes everyday items and using #5Arcane Ash#0, refines them into a pure representation of their parts, known as #5essences#0. The recipes for specific essences can be found under #9Items -> Essences#0. The essence refiner also requires #2Etherium#0 to function. Neutral Etherium can be obtained from an #9Obelisk#0, which has no specific advantages or drawbacks. Finally, Dark Etherium can be used from a #9Black Aurem#0, which significantly reduces the amount of time it takes to refine the essence.
compendium.essence_refiner.page2=The spinning ring on the UI will shift from blue to purple as the refinement process progresses and eventually completes. A flashing red ring means there is insufficient Etherium to continue, and the process has been paused.
compendium.essence_conduit.page1=Infused with dusts to direct Etherium through the air, the Etherium Conduit began seeing heavy use almost immediately after its invention. They can be used to transfer Etherium over longer distances than the direct range of Etherium generation apparatus. Each one has a range of 10 blocks, and can form chains to move Etherium up to 100 blocks away from the origin.
compendium.seer_stone.page1=Operating on a similar principle as the Astral Barrier, the Seer Stone uses an Etherium aura projected through a spell focus to detect nearby objects. It can be controlled by focusing the Etherium to a particular type of object, and the resonant frequency of the Etherium can be dictated with the use of a rune combination. Without the use of a rune combination, the resonant frequency fluxuates unpredictably and cannot be avoided. The seer stone, however, is meant for a more subtle approach, letting the object continue, but emitting a small signal that often activates much more powerful defenses. By sneaking up and activating the stone, one can even (if he has the correct key of course) cause the stone to invert its detection methods, detecting those with the matching keystone combination. !d Different #5Foci#0 can be used in the Seer Stone. #5Lesser, Standard, and Greater foci#0 change the detection distance of the stone (5, 10, or 15 blocks respectively), while #5Item, Player, Monster, or Creature foci#0 can change what the seer stone is looking for. Without a target focus and a distance focus, the seer stone will not function. !d A keystone is searched for in the case of a player. If the player has a keystone in their inventory matching the rune combination in the seer stone, the seer stone will ignore them and will not trigger. 
compendium.astral_barrier.page1=When walking the void, one must be aware of barriers. Projecting an Etherium aura through a spell focus, these barriers resonate at a specific magical frequency, dictated by a keytstone. Without the proper matching keystone, these barriers will destabilize your magics and force you out of the void. Should the astral barrier not have a keystone present, its magic frequency will fluxuate unpredictably, and no amount of Keystones can protect you from its effects. Several Dark Magi raids have been foiled and several Light Magi have been captured due to their failure to spot the barrier in time. !d Different #5Foci#0 can be used in the Astral Barrier. #5Lesser, Standard, and Greater foci#0 change the distance of the barrier, to 5, 10, or 15 blocks respectively. Without a distance focus, the barrier will not function. !d The barrier will stop teleportation into its radius, including ender pearls, blink, mark/recall, and endermen.
compendium.keystone_recepticle.page1=Not all magi are capable of walking the void as a means of travel, nor are all willing. The void is detectable, blockable. Gateways were developed by the Dark Magi early in the war, and it allowed them to take many Light Mage encampments by surprise, as it uses alternate pathways to transport to its destination. Astral Barriers were ineffective at stopping the arrival of the Dark Magi, and the destination gate required no power of its own. The Light Magi destroyed as many as they could find, but the Dark Magi only needed one. The only hope was when a young Light Mage by the name of Damien Callitri discovered that the gateways could be locked down if a Keystone was inserted into a flaw in the design at just the right spot in the gateway mechanism, and would actually cause the gateway to send the Dark Mages to a different gateway (or nowhere if none others existed that weren't locked down). This halted the raids completely, and allowed the White Magi to turn the tides back in their favour, as they could actually use the gateways to return to their keystone gate. The design flaw became jokingly known as the "Keystone Recepticle" amongst the White Magi.
compendium.vinteum_ore.page1=Vinteum was discovered during a heated battle between the Light and Dark magi when a stray arcane bolt collided with an ender bolt. The resulting explosion created a crater several meters deep, where a sparkling blue ore shimmered in the light of the afternoon. It appears to have no magical properties of its own, but when heat is applied, it becomes a fine dust with an exceptional capacity to conduct Etherium. As such, it is widely used in magical contraptions all over the world.
compendium.mana_battery.page1=Drawing further on vinteum dust's ability to conduct Etherium, a small group of brilliant magi created a frame out of iron and gold which is capable of storing massive amounts of Etherium. Mana batteries will always provide power to connected devices, but they can also request Etherium from the network when given a redstone signal.
compendium.cerublossom.page1=Cerublossom flowers thrive in lush, green environments. They were one of the first magical plants discovered, being used in potions and salves. Cerublossom emits a faint sparkling glow of light around it as well, and was used just as much for decoration as an alchemical ingredient. A short while after its discovery, it was also noted that the Cerublossom could be used as part of the purification process for Vinteum dust.
compendium.desert_nova.page1=Desert Novas grow in dry conditions. They get their name from the small bursts of magic that they periodically emit. The Nova has extraordinary magical properties for a desert plant, and is highly sought after. It is one of the two plants used in the purification process of Vinteum dust.
compendium.keystone_chest.page1=The keystone chest was developed as a simple way to have a magically locked chest. When a keystone is inserted into the internal slot, in order to open it, one must have a matching keystone in their hand. By inserting the keystone into the outer lock*, the chest can be opened. If there is no keystone, the chest opens normally. !l !l * Just right click the chest with the keystone in your hand.
compendium.magic_wall.page1=An early attempt at the illusion block, the magic wall wasn't really able to blend with it's surroundings. Or even prevent people from looking through. The value, though, was just after having master mage Leonidus criticize us for our efforts, watching him walk face first into one. That's when we knew it at least had the stopping power part right. But when the fireball he threw at it BOUNCED back and burnt his beard off, we knew it was a keeper.
compendium.arcane_reconstructor.page1=Magic can, with the right influence, do anything. By directing Etherium at the weak spots in otherwise mundane items, the Etherium will solidify to repair the damage, making it good as new.
compendium.lectern.page1=A must have for any organized mage, the Lectern is an ideal place to store books, compendiums, and thaumonomicons for easy access. The book sits perfectly where it can be read without having to remove it from the lectern. It is also a critical part of the Crafting Altar, as spell crafting does require organization.
compendium.occulus.page1=A gateway to the stars, the Occulus shows you your innermost self. It is here that you can spend skill points to unlock new shapes, components, and modifiers.
compendium.calefactor.page1=A magical furnace, the calefactor can produce vinteum dust as it cooks in addition to the smelted item. If provided with light, neutral, and dark etherium, the calefactor can double ores. It always has a small chance to double food.
compendium.inscription_table.page1=Organization is a must for any mage who wants to be successful. Using this table along with a writable book, you can compose spells of incredible power. Most mages will lay out what spell parts they know at the top of the table in the Source Region, and will drag shapes and modifiers to the brown squares set aside for Shape Groups, and components to the Spell Grammar section at the bottom to lay out a spell. Once satisfied with the spell, you can write the spells down in a writable book (you did remember to bring one, didn't you?). This book can be placed upon a lectern that is part of the Crafting Altar structure, and will guide you through the process needed to make the spell. The book is worth reading too, as it contains a recap of the spell you will be creating, a materials list, and an affinity breakdown. See #5Guides -> Your First Spell#0 for more detailed information.
compendium.particle_emmiter.page1=Purely a decoration block, the particle emitter can be used to create a magical feel in any area. The emitter can be customized by right clicking it, and it can be hidden. If hidden, simply holding a crystal wrench while near it will cause it to be visible again. Right clicking a particle emitter with a crystal wrench in unlink mode will cause its settings to be copied. Right clicking another particle emitter while also in unlink mode will copy those settings to the second emitter.
compendium.aum.page1=A flower with healing properties, Aum is a component in many spells. It can only be found at the base of witchwood trees.
compendium.tarma_root.page1=Lighter than it looks, Tarma Root grows in caves and other dark places. It is an ingredient in spells, and air essences.
compendium.wakebloom.page1=Growing on the surface of water in warm climates, wakebloom is used in water-based spells frequently as well as being a component in water essence.
compendium.summoner.page1=The summoner takes Etherium one step farther and uses it to summon creatures to do your bidding upon receipt of a redstone signal. It has a hefty summon cost, as well as a maintain cost to keep the summon alive. If the redstone signal ever dies out or power runs out, the creature will unsummon. When the creature is unsummoned or killed, there is a short delay before it can be summoned again. Note that the summoner requires a full-fledged summon spell, not a filled crystal phylactery.
compendium.witchwood_sapling.page1=Witchwood saplings can rarely be obtained from the leaves of a witchwood tree. They can be planted, however they need a source of Liquid Etherium within 1 block and below them (x/z +/- 1, y-1). The more liquid etherium source pools nearby (max 8), the faster the sapling will grow. Even with all 8, however, the grow time can be significant. Once the sapling grows into a full witchwood tree, it can sometimes also cause aum to grow nearby as well.
compendium.crafting_altar.page1=Harnessing the forces of creation, the crafting altar allows mages to work miracles of magic. This is where you will create all of your spells in AM2. The crafting altar is a component of a #9multiblock structure#0.
compendium.magicians_workbench.page1=The magician's workbench was born out of necessity from the large number of items mages tend to make. However, one particular mage got tired of having to clear out the crafting grid every time he forgot a sub-component, and having to run to a chest, usually dropping items along the way. This table #5has multiple crafting grids#0 that you can use simultaneously to make items. It also remembers previous crafting recipes (the most recent 8) and can restore that recipe to the crafting grid with the click of a button, provided the components are in its #5internal storage#0. There is an upgrade you can craft that will increase the size of the second grid to a 3x3 from a 2x2.
compendium.everstone.page1=Everstone is a magically-infused block that can mimic other blocks much like #5illusion blocks#0 can. However, when broken, Everstone will #9not drop, but rather become incorporeal for a brief time#0. After that time, it will re-solidify and return to its original state. While it is solidifying, everstone can be passed through as if it is not there. To make it mimic a block, simply right click on the everstone with the desired block in hand. If it is not already mimicing a block, it will assume the properties of the new block. To remove the mask, simply right click the everstone with a #5Crystal Wrench#0. Right clicking an everstone that is not already mimicing a texture will cause it to drop as normal and be recovered.
compendium.vinteum_torch.page1=Vinteum Torches are crafted in a simplistic way, and glow with roughly the same brightness as a standard torch. They are just an aesthetic alternative.
compendium.slipstream_generator.page1=You have managed to create a device that can project a cushion of air around you to make you float upwards or gently lower down towards the ground. The machine only works on mages above it (#5players only#0), but has a large vertical range. In testing, you note that if you are falling when you enter its effect radius, it takes a little while before it can completely catch you. You have also managed to make it work #9based on the direction you are looking#0. Look up, go up. Look down, go down. Look forward, hover. You can also #9sneak to remain vertically stationary#0, regardless of where you are looking.
compendium.broken_power_link.page1=If a power path is created, and at some point a relay (conduits, etc.) or generator (obelisk, prism, aurem, etc.) is broken, the power system will attempt to let you know that there was something there, and something is amiss. These blocks will be placed automatically by the power system if a broken link is detected. The block will be placed at the point where the relay or generator used to be. !d These blocks will only ever be placed where no other block exists. They cannot be broken by hand, but can be replaced with any block. Broken power link blocks are only visible if you are wearing a pair of #9Magitech's Goggles#0
compendium.flicker_habitat.page1=The flicker habitat is a series of crystals designed to allow Flickers to remain in our world. If a #9Flicker Focus#0 is added, the flickers inside the focus will use the habitat to perform several tasks around the area, such as growing plants, sorting items, fishing, creating magical barriers, and many other functions. !d You can also place a #9Flicker Jar#0 in the habitat and it will serve to modify the functionality of adjacent habitats with a Flicker Focus in them. !d See the flicker focus entries for more information on how they can be modified.
compendium.flicker_lure.page1=Flickers aren't normally able to enter our world, but with a little help and incentive, you can make that happen. Placing this block and powering it with Etherium will allow flickers to be pulled into our world! When you want them, just apply a redstone signal. The type of flicker will depend on where the lure is. See the entry on #9Flickers#0 for information on where to find specific ones.
compendium.arcane_deconstructor.page1=The Arcane Deconstructor, when powerd with #5Dark Etherium#0 can disassemble an item back into its crafting components. !d Oh yeah, it can also disassemble spells. You will get most of the items back from a spell, but items such as the initial blank rune or etherium investments, as well as the final spell parchment, will not be refunded. !d The deconstructor will attempt to place items into adjacent inventories if its own is full upon un-crafting. Any items that cannot be placed are simply ejected into the world.
compendium.otherworld_aura.page1=The Otherworldly Aura is used to automate spell creation. It summons a shadow copy of whoever created it to complete the spell. !d To use it, you need the following: !l -Within 10 blocks of the #5Crafting Altar#0 !l -#4Dark#0 or #9Neutral#0 Etherium (have a good amount on hand, interdimensional travel is costly!) !l -One or more block inventories (chest, hopper, etc) within 8 blocks of the Aura. These inventories are what will be searched for spell reagents. !d The aurem will maintain the shadow for as long as needed, provided it has enough power. Running out of power will cause the shadow to dissipate, and out of spite for the inconvenience, it may take whatever reagent it is currently carrying! Only one aura will assist an altar at a time, so multiple auras are not needed. !d To get the aura, perform a #5Ritual of the Cross#0 around an #5Inert Spawner#0 with #5Transplace#0 as the catalyst.
compendium.inert_spawner.page1=You've managed to pick up a monster spawner, but it seems to not be able to spawn anything anymore. You should look into other applications for this device, or find a way to re-activate it. !d Perhaps #5Dark Etherium#0 and a #5Filled Crystal Phylactery#0 could make it function again...

compendium.block.inlays.redstone_inlay.name=Redstone Inlay
compendium.block.inlays.iron_inlay.name=Iron Inlay
compendium.block.inlays.gold_inlay.name=Gold Inlay

compendium.inlays.page1=Inlays are runes that are used both for decoration and for summoning bosses when placed into the right pattern (see Structures). There are a few different types of Inlay.
compendium.redstone_inlay.page1=Redstone inlays are the most basic of inlay. They are used to summon bosses, and can also be used as rails. They will speed up a minecart as it passes over them. Be wary when cornering too fast, as the cart can leave the tracks entirely.
compendium.iron_inlay.page1=Iron inlays are an intermediate inlay. They are used to summon bosses, and can also be used as rails. When a minecart touches an iron inlay, it will reverse direction. Some of the momentum is preserved, but not all.
compendium.gold_inlay.page1=Gold inlays are the most advanced inlay. They are used to summon the most powerful of bosses. They can also be used as rails. When a minecart touches a gold inlay, it will attempt to warp to the next gold inlay in the direction it is currently traveling within 8 blocks. This can transport the minecart (and any passengers) through solid obstacles, as it is in fact teleportation. There is a short delay before the minecart can teleport on a gold rail again after it warps.

compendium.block.keystone_doors.name=Keystone Doors

compendium.keystone_doors.page1=Keystone Doors can be locked using a rune combination. If locked, they will only open if you have a keystone with the matching key in your inventory. If not locked, they function simply as a door. Zombies cannot break them down either way.

compendium.crystal_markers.page1=Crystal Markers are used to instruct Flickers inside of a Flicker Habitat on how to sort items. When wearing #9Magitech Goggles#0, you can see the priority level of the different crystals. This priority indicates the order in which the flickers will attempt to move items. Lower priority crystals are tried first. You can change the priority of any crystal by rght clicking it while holding a #9Magitech's Staff#0.
compendium.crystal_marker_import.page1=This crystal instructs the flickers to collect items from the inventory it is attached to and bring it into the item transportation network. Import crystals cannot have a priority level.
compendium.crystal_marker_export.page1=This crystal instructs the flickers that all items in the item transportation network can be exported to the inventory this crystal is attached to.
compendium.crystal_marker_mimic_export.page1=This crystal instructs the flickers that items maybe exported from the item transportation network to the inventory this crystal is attached to so long as the inventory already contains that item.
compendium.crystal_marker_set_export.page1=This crystal instructs the flickers that items may be exported from the item transportation network to the inventory this crystal is attached to so long as the item has been set through this crystal's GUI.
compendium.crystal_marker_regulate_export.page1=This crystal instructs the flickers that items may be exported from the item transportation network to the inventory this crystal is attached to so long as the item has been set through this crystal's GUI and the inventory contains less then number of items set in the crystal's GUI.
compendium.crystal_marker_regulate_bidirectional.page1=This crystal instructs the flickers that they may both import and export from the inventory this crystal is attached to !d Import: !l Flickers will take items from the inventory so long as the item has been added to this crystal's GUI and the number of items in the chest is greater then the number set in the GUI !d Export: !l Flickers will put items into the inventory so long as the item has been added to this crystal's GUI and the number of items is below the number set in the GUI.
compendium.crystal_marker_set_import.page1=This crystal instructs the flickers that they may import items into the item transportation network from the inventory this crystal is attached to so long as the item has been added to this crystal's GUI.
compendium.crystal_marker_final_export.page1=This crystal instructs the flickers that they should put any items that can't otherwise be placed in the inventory marked by this crystal. These crystals always have the highest priority number, meaning items will be placed there last.
compendium.crystal_marker_spell_export.page1=This crystal instructs the flickers to watch any crafting altar within 10 blocks. If it is crafting a spell, the flickers will attempt to fetch the next item required for the spell and place it in the inventory marked by this crystal.

compendium.keystone.page1=Keystones are used to link Gateways to each other, as well as to restrict access to Ars Magica machines. The UI for these blocks will not open if you are not holding a keystone with the same rune combination.
compendium.mana_cake.page1=Mana Cakes both restore hunger and give a boost to mana regeneration. Plus, it's cake!
compendium.crystal_wrench.page1=The crystal wrench serves many purposes. It can be used to direct Etherium through your power network. To do this, #9right click first on the source of Etherium you want to use#0. This marks the source block. Then, #9right click on the destination while still holding the wrench#0. #5Note that there is no need to click on Etherium Conduits along the way - just click on the final block. The power system will attempt to pathfind through nearby Etherium Conduits automatically#0. If that fails for any reason, you will be notified. This will force a pairing, and ensures the Etherium goes where you want it to.
compendium.crystal_wrench.page2=If you #9sneak while right clicking on the source#0, the wrench's crystal will turn green. This means the crystal wrench is remembering the source block's location, and you can click on several destinations in a row without having to return to the source. Each destination right clicked on in this state will be paired (if possible) to the remembered source.
compendium.crystal_wrench.page3=You can also disconnect power nodes by #9Sneaking and right clicking#0 on a #5non-powered block#0. This will switch the wrench's mode from link to unlink. You can see the change when the crystal on the wrench turns red. To switch it back, simply repeat the sneak right click to change the crystal back to purple. If you have a stored location, it will need to be cleared first before the mode can be switched (which is also done by sneak right-clicking a non-powered block).
compendium.crystal_wrench.page4=The crystal wrench can also be used to show hidden particle emitters, and can copy their settings by right clicking when in unlink mode. The settings can then be pasted to another emitter by right clicking. Each time you "paste" settings, you will need to copy them again if you wish to paste to additional emitters.
compendium.spell_parchment.page1=Any mage that wants to cast spells without the need of some sort of staff or wand needs something to write the spell down on. This has worked for thousands of years, and surprisingly nothing more effective has been invented yet.
compendium.crystal_phylactery.page1=The crystal phylactery is a life-force capturing device. A magic user who has one of these in her inventory can trap small pieces of souls from slain foes. Once the phylactery is full, she can use it as a component for a spell to summon that very creature to do her bidding.
compendium.spell_staff_magitech.page1=The magitech's staff is a modified version of a spell staff that is attuned to ambient mana. It can be used to sense the Etherium levels in powered blocks by right clicking the block with the staff in your hand. It gains additional functionality if you have the #9Magitech's Goggles#0 equipped. !d The Magitech's Staff can also be used to reclaim a #9Magic Broom#0. Simply right click the broom with the staff in your hand to reclaim it.
compendium.spell_book.page1=The spell book is a useful item to have, allowing mages to organize their spells and save space at the same time. The spell book, when equipped, can be scrolled through either by pressing x/z (default), or by sneaking and rolling the mouse wheel. Spell books can be dyed a variety of different colors. They can also be #5enchanted#0 with some useful powers.
compendium.magic_broom.page1=You have taken the magical properties of Arcane Ash and combined them with a broom. Why? You're not entirely sure. What you do know is that this broom loves to keep the area clean, picking up any loose items near it and putting them in it's assigned chest. To place the broom once you craft it, right click on a #5any block with an inventory#0 with the broom equipped. It won't work otherwise. Currently the broom will grab all loose items, though it will be configurable at a later time. !d The broom can be reclaimed by right clicking it with a #9Magitech's Staff#0 in your hand.
compendium.nature_scythe.page1=Taken from the guardian of nature itself, this scythe wields immense power. It can clear leaves and plants with astounding efficiency. It can be thrown like a boomerang by right clicking, though it costs 250 mana to do so. All plant clearing effects apply while thrown, and damage is increased.
compendium.arcane_spellbook.page1=Imbued with unknowable enchantments by ancient mages, the arcane spell book #9increases the effectiveness of all spells cast from it#0. Damage is increased, and mana cost is lowered. Things like duration and radius are not modified.
compendium.winter_arm.page1=Taken from the guardian of winter, this arm can be used as a blunt weapon. It retains its unearthly chill, and drastically slows and weakens all struck with it. For 250 mana, it can be thrown, and will pull back an entity to you if it is hit by the arm, applying a more powerful slow and weaken effect.
compendium.air_sled.page1=The air sled allows you to take to the sky with ease. It is slightly faster than creative mode flight, but does not afford the same level of control.
compendium.earth_armor.page1=The earth armor is the chest of the guardian of earth. It offers significant physical damage resistance for a single piece of armor. It adds a sizeable amount of damage (+4) and knockback to unarmed strikes (no item equipped).
compendium.water_orbs.page1=The water orbs allow you to control water subconsciously. While wearing them (they are a leg slot item), you will not be pushed by flowing liquids. You will also have infinite breath while underwater.
compendium.fire_ears.page1=The fire antenna, when worn, grant full immunity to fire and lava.
compendium.workbench_upgrade.page1=You've figured out a way to make an upgrade for the Magician's workbench that makes the secondary grid a 3x3 instead of a 2x2. Simply craft it and right click a placed bench to apply it. Keep in mind, the modifications are rather fragile, and will break off if the workbench is destroyed and will have to be re-made.
compendium.warding_candle.page1=Warding Candles, when held, are moving sources of light. They can also be #9attuned#0 to a specific block by #9sneaking and right clicking on the block while holding the candle#0. This will cause the candle flame to turn blue when within 15 blocks of the specified block, and red when within 5 blocks. A warding candle will burn for 15 minutes, but is put out when not equipped. !d Warding candles are also used in #5Rituals#0, and are placed down as part of the layout. A Warding Candle that has been attuned cannot be used in a ritual.
compendium.flicker_jar.page1=Flicker Jars are used to catch flickers. Simply right click on the flicker and you will trap it inside the jar. Sounds simple, right? Have fun...
compendium.ender_boots.page1=The Ender Boots are a rare drop from the #5Ender Guardian#0. When wearing these boots, #9sneaking and jumping will reverse gravity#0! This will only apply to you, and you will fall upwards. Normal falling damage applies. You cannot reverse gravity while airborne.
compendium.lightning_charm.page1=The Lightning Charm is a rare drop from the #5Lightning Guardian#0. Sneaking and right clicking will toggle the item on and off. When on, its static electricity draws in nearby items automatically.
compendium.lifeward.page1=The Life Ward is a rare drop from the #5Life Guardian#0. When in your action bar, you will slowly generate a shield around you that will absorb incoming damage. It will generate up to 20 additional temporary hit points. The hit points remain if the Ward is removed from your inventory, but will not replenish themselves without it.
compendium.magitech_goggles.page1=The Magitech's Goggles are a companion piece to the #9Magitech's Staff#0. When worn, you can sneak and right click powered blocks with a Magitech's Staff. You will then be able to see all of the incoming power types to the selected machine, and where they come from. The goggles will also allow you to see broken power links; where a power path was before, but something went wrong (for example, a conduit was broken). Broken power link blocks cannot be broken by hand, but they can be replaced by any block.
compendium.chalk.page1=Wizard's Chalk is used to create #9Rituals#0 by drawing the correct shapes on the ground.
compendium.journal.page1=Journals can be used to #9record your experiences#0 for later use. These experiences can #9later be recovered by reading the journal#0.
compendium.deficit_crystal.page1=Often noted as the antimatter of magic, Deficit represents a void in the fabric of reality. You've managed to create a refined, crystallized version of it. Crystals like these are often used in the unmaking of things.

compendium.sunstone.page1=Sunstone is only found in the most intently hot locations in all of Minecraft and worlds beyond. Requiring such intense heat to form, but very low pressure, it is commonly found in the lava lakes of the nether, but can exist in the lava pools of the overworld as well, if you are lucky.
compendium.moonstone.page1=If one were to look up at the sky at the right time of night, one may see a meteor descending from the sky. These meteors contain the rare mineral Moonstone. Where exactly these meteors came from, nobody knows, but the magical properties of Moonstone far excel anything else found in the world.

compendium.flicker_focus.page1=Flicker foci are used to create livable conditions inside a #9Flicker Habitat#0 for Flickers. It will enable them to perform several tasks, each of which are detailed to the right.
compendium.flicker_focus_itemtransport.page1=The air flickers contained within this crystal have been attuned to the movement of items. Placing this within a #9Flicker Habitat#0 will allow you to link it with #9Crystal Markers#0 to interact with inventories containing items. To link the habitat containing this foci with a #9Crystal Marker#0 simply right click on the #9Flicker Habitat#0 then right click on the #9Crystal Marker#0. This foci can be upgraded using additional #9Flicker Habitats#0 with flickers inside them. This foci can operate without access to Etherium however it is very slow. Adding power increases the speed and allows the foci to make use of attached upgrades.
compendium.flicker_focus_itemtransport.page2=Arcane: !l Increases the number of items the flickers inside can move at one time. The first arcane flicker will increase the count to 32, each additional arcane flicker will add an additional 32 items to the air flickers carrying capacity !d Lightning: !l Lightning flickers will increase the speed at which the flickers move items. Additional lightning flickers after the first will still increase the speed but suffer from diminishing returns. Most Magitechs belive its a waste to go higher then three lightning flickers.
compendium.flicker_focus_interdiction.page1=Arcane and air flickers working together can create a wall around their habitat if they are provided enough Etherium to do so. By placing this focus in a #9Flicker Habitat#0 and providing it with Etherium a nearly invisible wall is created in a 6 block radius from the #9Flicker Habitat#0. Modifying this with an #9Ender Flicker Jar#0 will also cause the #9Containment#0 effect to apply. !d Placing #9Ice Flicker Upgrades#0 to this focus will increase the radius of the containment field by one per ice flicker added.
compendium.flicker_focus_containment.page1=Ender and air flickers working in tandem can create a wall surrounding their #9Flicker Habitat#0 provided they have been given the Etherium to do so. Placing this focus in a habitat and providing it with Etherium will create a nearly invisible wall in a 6 block radius from their #9Flicker Habitat#0 that non-player entities can not pass out of. Modifying this with an #9Arcane Flicker Jar#0 will also cause the #9Interdiction#0 effect to apply. !d Placing #9Ice Flicker Upgrades#0 to this focus will increase the radius of the containment field by one per ice flicker added.
compendium.flicker_focus_packed_earth.page1=Earth flickers when contained within this focus can flatten terrain in a 6 block radius around their #9Flicker Habitat#0 using materials stored in an inventory below their habitat. While these flickers can operate without access to Etherium they are much faster when they have access to a source of power.
compendium.flicker_focus_flatlands.page1=The earth and ice flickers inside this focus will flatten a 6 block radius area surrounding their #9Flicker Habitat#0. They can operate without power but are much more effective when connected to a source of Etherium.
compendium.flicker_focus_progeny.page1=The life flickers inside this focus can use a source of Etherium to cause animals within 8 blocks to breed. This focus requires etherium of any kind for each operation. The default operation time is 2000 ticks (100 seconds), but this can be reduced by placing additional habitats adjacent to the original and placing lightning flicker jars in them. There isn't much point in adding more than 4, as the minimum is 600 ticks (30 seconds). Each upgrade multiplies the current duration by 0.75, so the effect is diminishing.
compendium.flicker_focus_butchery.page1=The flickers inside this focus are constantly at odds. The fire flicker seeks to consume the life around its self, while the life flicker seeks to defend it. The balance that is struck in this conflict is that all but two of every animal type with a 6 block radius around the #9Flicker Habitat#0 that contains this focus will eventually be killed. Provided that the fire flicker has access to a source of Etherium to do its grisly work.
compendium.flicker_focus_lunartides.page1=The three flickers inside this focus can use their combined power to pull moonstone meteors that would land within 128 blocks of their #9Flicker Habitat#0 to land within 8 blocks. However to accomplish this they need a trickle of Etherium to keep them alert and watching for meteors.
compendium.flicker_focus_light.page1=The fire and lightning flickers contained within can use the power of the sun stone used in the construction of their focus to light a 16 block radius around their #9Flicker Habitat#0.
compendium.flicker_focus_felled_oak.page1=The nature flicker contained within this focus will seek out trees within a 6 block radius around their #9Flicker Habitat#0, once they do the lightning flickers will fell the tree one block at a time. These flickers can operate without a source of power but they are much faster when they have a source of Etherium to fuel themselves. !d Lightning flickers can be used as augments to make the process faster as well. !d If a nature flicker augment is added, the flickers will also re-plant saplings from an adjacent chest.
compendium.flicker_focus_gentle_rains.page1=The water flicker contained within this focus will hydrate the terrain in a 6 block radius around it's #9Flicker Habitat#0.
compendium.flicker_focus_natures_bounty.page1=The life, nature and water flickers contained within this focus will work together to help all plants within a 6 block radius grow faster. These hard working flickers will help all nearby plants with or without Etherium but providing them with a source of power will allow them to do their work faster. When powered, modifying this habitat with a #9Water Flicker Jar#0 will also cause the #9Gentle Rains#0 effect to apply.
compendium.flicker_focus_fishing.page1=The combination of Water and Nature flickers causes them to be able to find creatures that live in water. It does require power to maintain the search, however, as the flickers cover a great distance in a short time. If augmented with adjacent habitats containing lightning flickers, they are able to move even faster, causing them to naturally find fish more often. Doing so will increase the overall power use.
compendium.flicker_focus_fishing.page2=The focus requires a 3x3 square of water below it that is also at least 2 blocks deep in order to function. It will output fish into an adjacent inventory if possible, or drop them as an item if no inventory is present. !d A redstone signal must be provided for the flickers to start working.

The hecate is an assassin - it moves extremely fast and can turn invisible briefly when attacking. They deal a large amount of damage, but thankfully don't have much in terms of resilience It's rumored that if you move slowly and quietly enough, you can pass by them undetected as long as you don't get too close.
compendium.mana_elemental.page1=The mana elemental is a combination of vinteum shards held together by bolts of Etherium. They are towering creatures, often reaching 3m in height. They attack with bolts of raw mana that lash out, dealing minor damage but stealing mana, and return to the elemental, healing it based on the amount of mana stolen. They are highly resistant to physical damage. If all the mana is drained from the elemental, it will die.
compendium.mana_creeper.page1=The mana creeper is a variant on the normal creeper, but instead of a violent explosion, the mana creeper disintegrates into a mana vortex, which will drain the mana of everything nearby. The vortex grows the longer it lives, but luckily all of them don't last for more than a few seconds. The vortex drains more mana the more you have, so it is still a threat to even the most powerful of magi.
compendium.light_mage.page1=Light magi are part of the white council. They are powerful mages who have dedicated themselves to the forces of light.

compendium.fire_elemental.page1=Fire elementals are beings of pure fire. They are destructive and ignite anything in their path. Fire Elementals are only found in the nether.
compendium.water_elemental.page1=Water elementals are beings of pure water. They are found anywhere water is in abundance. They attack in groups, using water to push and pull their target. They can affect their targets with Watery Grave, which will pull unsuspecting down to the crushing black depths.
compendium.earth_elemental.page1=Earth elementals are found slumbering deep within caves. They are passive by nature, and boast an extreme resistance to physical damage. Combined with a high health pool, anyone learning to summon one could conjure up a veritable tank. Their attacks force the target to focus on them and they will try to bounce from target to target.
compendium.dryad.page1=Dryads are peaceful creatures often found in forests and grasslands. They can be lured with a sapling and will periodically make nearby plants grow faster.
compendium.darkling.page1=Darklings are small dog-like creatures that are found in the nether. Their body becomes less visible during night, fading to near invsibility at midnight.

compendium.flickers.page1=Flickers are lesser elementals from the various elemental planes that have crossed over into our world. Their magical bond is tenuous at best and they are known for "Flicking" back and forth between their plane and ours. They are the starting point for #5Ars Magica Automation#0. !d Flickers are timid by nature and will flick back to their own dimension if attacked, or if they feel threatened. Giving them a modicum of magic in the form of #5some sort of lasting effect#0 makes them feel more comfortable and less likely to run away. #5Flickers can be captured inside of a Flicker Jar#0.
compendium.flickers.page2=There is one type of flicker for each affinity. Flickers of each affinity will behave differently. For example, Air Flickers tend to like to stay higher above the ground, while Earth Flickers will prefer to stay low. !d Flickers of each affinity can be found near regions of the world that remind them of their affinity.

compendium.air_guardian.page1=The Air Guardian is a being of wind, and makes heavy use of knockback based attacks. It would be foolish to go into battle with one without some form of falling protection. The Air Guardian is a powerful ranged caster, but it requires a great deal of focus to finish some of it's spells... !l Recommended level: 35
compendium.air_guardian.page2=To summon the Air Guardian, climb up well above the clouds and build a platform (y 150 or higher). Build a gold inlay ring on the platform and throw in an Air Essence.
compendium.arcane_guardian.page1=A mage of ancient times, the Arcane Guardian has access to a wide variety of spells. From attacks to buffs to debuffs, prepare for a magical duel that will test your counterspell knowledge. Protected by a powerful sigil, the Arcane Guardian has as many tricks against melee opponents as it does against ranged attackers. !l Recommended level: 45
compendium.arcane_guardian.page2=To summon the Arcane Guardian, first construct a Shrine of Knowledge. The shrine is 2 pillars of bookshelves, 3 high, with a lectern on the ground in between them containing an Arcane Compendium. Place an iron inlay circle directly in front of the structure, and throw an Arcane Essence directly in the middle of the circle to start the ritual.
compendium.earth_guardian.page1=Formed out of a core of stone, the Earth Guardian is a hardy opponent that can withstand incredible amounts of physical attacks. With whirling attacks and strength of the earth itself, be prepared for a fight. !l Recommended level: 25
compendium.earth_guardian.page1=To summon the Earth Guardian, first build a 3x3 obsidian platform with a chiseled stone brick at the centre. On top of the obsidian, build an iron inlay ring. Off of each side, on the same level as the inlays, place a vinteum torch. Then throw in a blue topaz, an emerald, and a chimerite. !d Upon summoning, the Earth Guardian will cleave out a large area of the surrounding blocks, so it would be wise to summon somewhere other than your basement. 
compendium.fire_guardian.page1=The Fire Guardian is a living inferno from the depths of the nether. To summon it, create a gold inlay ring in the nether on top of obsidian with a coal block in the middle. Throw a water essence onto the coal and the fire guardian will appear.

compendium.life_guardian.page1=The life guardian generally prefers to let the natural order of things take their course, not intervening unless a true sacriledge against life is performed. Luckily (or unluckily, depending on how you look at it) for you, you have come up with a way to commit such an act. Create a 5x5 ring using wizard's chalk, and place a warding candle in the center part of each side, on the outside of the ring (4 candles in total). 
compendium.life_guardian.page2=The circle will help to contain and focus the deed. Then, on the night of a full moon, sacrifice a villager child inside the circle. That should be enough to anger the life guardian to action. !d You monster you.
compendium.life_guardian.page3=The life guardian doesn't attack much on its own, though it may decide to throw you around a little. It generally prefers to let others do the fighting for it, infusing them with its tremendous power. In return, the others will often lay down their lives for the guardian's protection. The life guardian is a different kind of fight than the other guardians. !d Recommended level: 50

It has also on occasion been able to replicate an effect similar to telekinesis using massive amounts of concentrated static electricity, which leaves the unfortunate victim open to several other effects.
compendium.lightning_guardian.page2=To summon the lightning guardian, create a #5Gold Inlay Ring#0 and place a mana battery in the middle. Then, place 2 iron bars on top, creating a lightning rod. !d Finally, wait for a storm. !d This guardian is capable of doing extreme damage in a short amount of time. Make sure you are well protected. Recommended Level: 70
compendium.ender_guardian.page1=Tales are told in hushed whispers of the true guardian of the End. Of eyes glowing with an abhorrent light, and scaly skin as black as a moonless night. Alas, the tales of this waking nightmare are vague at best and always shrouded in the veil of speculation. The truth is, nobody has ever seen the guardian and lived. The most common tale is that of Magnus Severinus, the Archmage of the Second Era. 
compendium.ender_guardian.page2=At the height of his power, he was rumored to be able to move mountains with a thought, create lush gardens out of the most barren terrain, and create wards that could stop an army cold. Alas, his most trusted advisor took ill, and her spiteful stepson had taken her place. Goaded by honeyed words encouraging his power and making him arrogant, he gathered the conclave together and in front of them all, tore open the fabric between worlds, opening a portal to the end that pulsed with a soft purple glow that almost seemed to draw light away from its surroundings.
compendium.ender_guardian.page3=He stepped in, and summoned the guardian. He never had time to scream. A piece of paper, flecked with bits of dark blood, flitted back through the portal and it winked shut. Upon the paper was the following ritual:
compendium.ender_guardian.page4=In the End, around a black aurem atop a platform of blackest coal, create an inlay of gold. Light a burning fire on each side of the inlay. Throw in an Ender Essence and an Eye of Ender to destabilize the aurem and summon the guardian. !d The paper was locked away in magical vaults and forgotten for millenia...until now.
compendium.nature_guardian.page1=The Nature Guardian is a fearsome opponent. Boasting a deadly scythe and the skill to use it, only the most powerful or foolish would seek it out. The few who have survived an encounter state that it is just as dangerous at range as in melee, if not more. !l Recommended level: 60
compendium.nature_guardian.page2=Rumor has it that it appears to guard the servants of nature when enough are slain in quick succession. Nature can be harsh, but it will not tolerate a massacre. !d Warning: !l This is a very difficult boss that can take down even the most well geared players. 
compendium.water_guardian.page1=The guardian of water is a unique being. It is always in a state of fluidity, making it able to shrug off attacks occasionally. It is a trickster as well, flowing into copies of itself and attacking from ambush if one is fooled by the decoy. !l Recommended level: 10
compendium.water_guardian.page2=The water guardian can be summoned by creating a redstone inlay circle in any biome that is predominantly water. Then, while raining, throw a boat and a bucket of water into the circle as homage to the many ships lost at sea. 
compendium.winter_guardian.page1=The Winter Guardian is truly the embodiment of it's namesake. Surrounded by frigid winds that sap the strength of all who near it, the Winter Guardian pummels its frozen foes and shatters them with powerful strikes.
compendium.winter_guardian.page2=To summon the Winter Guardian, seek out an area in the grips of winter. Place a gold inlay circle on the ground and build an effigy to the Winter Guardian in the centre, Ice on top of two Blue Topaz blocks. Then create 3 snow golems close by to fuel the summoning. !d Warning: !l This is a very difficult boss that can take down even the most well geared players.
